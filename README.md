ImageAnalysisVX.X.X.py
- This is the backbone and major component for this project. Includes the code for both a 3D and 2D break down
of the Histology and CMP Fluorescence Taged Intervertebral Discs. Also returns a % value, which quantifies the
amount of tissue present in the image, and gives a referance of how much of the tissue is degenerated (dark holes)

Histology Sample Image.jpg
- This is the sample image provived by me. It is a great example of what eitehr a Histology or CMP Fluorescence Tagged
image should look like. Very little area of non-tissue (emptyness, slide, background etc.). Clear boundries between
degeration within the disc and the actual tissue
